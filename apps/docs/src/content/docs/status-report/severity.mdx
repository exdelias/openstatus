To help you and your users to understand the severity of an incident, we have defined a set of severity levels. You can select one of the following severity levels when you create a status report.

You don't have to select a severity level and can always delete it.

The severity level will be displayed in both the status page report and email notifications sent to subscribers. This helps your users quickly understand the impact level of any incident.
