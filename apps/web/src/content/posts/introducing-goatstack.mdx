## What is the GoaT stack?

The GoaT stack is a full-stack app template featuring a Golang server and a Vite + React SPA front end.

We want the GoaT stack to have a great DX.


### What is included in the GoaT stack?

**SQLite**: We have chosen SQLite as the database because we love it. Itâ€™s just a file.
**LiteStream**: To backup our database


**Protocol Buffer with ConnecTRPC**: For their http based protocol that works with Protocol Buffer.

**Chi**: For our Golang router
**[connectrpc.com/connect](https://connectrpc.com/connect)**: To handle http based request


**React**: Our frontend framework of choice.
**TanStack Query + Connect-Query **: to generate our typesafe query
**TanStack Router**: The typed router is joy to work with.

### API: Schema First Approach

Using Protocol Buffer we can design our API in `proto` file


### Why not going full stack TypeScript
Because we have worked in a large monorepo, we have often been frustrated by the number of times we had to restart our TypeScript LSP.

Additionally, we love Golang. We heavily rely on it for OpenStatus.

## How to get started with the Goat Stack


### Requirements

To get started you need to have these  installed on your computer

- [Just](https://just.systems)
- [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)



### Get Started
1. First clone our repository : https://github.com/openstatusHQ/goat-stack

2. Run
```bash
just init
```

It will download all the dependancies.

3. Open your IDE and update `packages/proto/goat/v1/goat.proto`
Add new procedure in the GoatService

4. Run `just buf`

5. Implement the handler in the server

6. Start calling it in your React App with the newly generated query


### How to deploy it.

We provide 2 docker files to deploy the dashboard and the server where you want. For example our server for [GoatStack.dev](https://GoatStack.dev) is hosted on Koyeb.

Before deploying the server you need to update `apps/server/etc/litestream.yml` with your S3 compatible bucket key to backup your database.
